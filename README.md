# About Me

Hello, My name is Tanner Cagle. I'm a software engineer focused on solving problems and getting results with secure and maintanable code. I'm currently working with backend languages such as Python, Java, and C++ and frontend technologies such as Html/Css, JS, and Bootstrap. Let's build something!

# Projects

A few coding projects I have completed outside of school or work in order to solve problems and have fun.

### Project 1: Monster Chamber
Monster Chamber is a coding challenge where I used minimal libraries to create a fun text-based RPG using Python. I had to implement unique solutions to the many technical issues that arose throughout the development process.
