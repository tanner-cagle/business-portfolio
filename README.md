# About Me

Hello, My name is Tanner Cagle. I'm a software engineer focused on solving problems and getting results with secure and maintanable code. I'm currently working with backend languages such as Python, Java, and C++ and frontend technologies such as Html/Css, JS, and Bootstrap. Let's build something today!

# Projects

Some of the coding projects I have completed outside of school or work in order to solve problems and have fun.

### Project 1: Monster Chamber

Monster Chamber is a coding challenge where I used minimal libraries to create a fun text-based RPG. I had to implement many solutions to the unique technical issues that arose throughout the development process. I also focused on good coding practices, OOP, and readability. 5000+ lines and counting!

Technologies used: Python, Trello, OneNote
